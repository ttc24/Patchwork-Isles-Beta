# Triage Rubric

Use this rubric to classify incoming feedback into **bug**, **balance**, **clarity**, or **pacing** buckets and assign a severity tier.

## Issue Types

### Bug
A functional defect where the game behaves incorrectly or crashes.
- Examples: soft-locks, missing collisions, broken quest triggers, crashes.

### Balance
A tuning problem where values or systems are skewed.
- Examples: enemy damage spikes, rewards too generous, economy grindy.

### Clarity
A communication problem where intent, goals, or affordances are unclear.
- Examples: confusing UI, missing tutorial prompts, unclear objectives.

### Pacing
A rhythm or tempo problem where the experience feels too slow, too fast, or uneven.
- Examples: long downtime between goals, abrupt difficulty spikes, overly long travel time.

## Severity Tiers

### S1 — Critical
Blocks play or causes data loss.
- Examples: crashes, hard/soft locks, save corruption.

### S2 — High
Major impact on the experience with no workaround or only a painful one.
- Examples: quest progression frequently fails, severe performance hitches.

### S3 — Medium
Noticeable issue that degrades experience but has a workaround.
- Examples: repeatable UI glitches, balance spikes in specific encounters.

### S4 — Low
Minor annoyance or cosmetic issue.
- Examples: typos, small VFX glitches, minor clipping.

### S5 — Note
Observations or requests for consideration, not clearly broken.
- Examples: “Feels slow,” “UI could be clearer.”

## Triage Checklist
1. Identify **type** (bug/balance/clarity/pacing).
2. Assign **severity** (S1–S5).
3. Add **repro steps** and **frequency** if applicable.
4. Note **player impact** and **workarounds**.
5. Log **evidence** (screenshots, video, logs).
