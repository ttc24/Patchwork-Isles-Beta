# v0.9 Minimum Playable Beta Spec

## Purpose
Deliver a compact, replayable story module that demonstrates the Patchwork Isles core loop in a 15–30 minute session while honoring world bible authoring rules (3–5 choices, tag-gated + tagless routes, no hard locks, vivid prose). The module should introduce faction reputation, a single trait reward, and at least one ending that cleanly resolves the arc.

## Golden Path (15–30 min)
**Session frame:** Start at Sky Docks, follow a linear-but-branchable path through Root Court Market and Prism Galleria, and resolve the guest-law dispute with a clear ending.

1. **Sky Docks: Guest-Law Dispute Ignites**
   - **Beat:** A Wind Choir dockmaster asks the player to mediate a dispute over a broken songline tether.
   - **Tag Gate:** **Diplomat** to open formal negotiation and gain a Wind Choir escort.
   - **Tagless Route:** Spend a **favor** to secure a neutral mediator.
   - **Reputation Beat:** +1 **Wind Choirs** if the player chooses the formal route; −1 if they defy protocol.

2. **Root Court Market: Living Contract Review**
   - **Beat:** The Root Court offers to interpret the contract if the player can retrieve a missing clause.
   - **Tag Gate:** **Archivist** to decode the clause in a living ledger.
   - **Trait Beat:** **People-Reader** reveals a hidden witness who can corroborate the clause.
   - **Tagless Route:** Use **favor** or **Freehands** rep (≥1) to bribe a courier for the clause.
   - **Reputation Beat:** +1 **Root Court** when the clause is returned intact.

3. **Prism Galleria: Proof in the Light**
   - **Beat:** The Prism Guild requests a prism shard to project the clause publicly.
   - **Tag Gate:** **Lumenar** to align the projection safely.
   - **Tagless Route:** Spend a **prism shard** or accept a time delay (costing −1 **Prism Guild**).
   - **Reputation Beat:** +1 **Prism Guild** for clean projection; −1 if the display fractures.

4. **Resolution: Guest-Law Codified (Clean Ending)**
   - **Beat:** The clause is accepted, and the dockmaster grants a long-term escort contract.
   - **Ending:** **“Codified Guest-Law”** — the player secures safe passage, a short epilogue, and a forward lead to the next hub.

## Alternate Endings & Fail-Soft Routes
Each ending must be reachable via a tagless option; no hard locks.

1. **Hidden Canal Escape (Alternate Ending)**
   - **Route:** Align with the **Freehands** and use **Sneaky** or a **favor** to slip through a maintenance canal.
   - **Outcome:** End the arc by departing the Sky Docks under cover of a false manifest.

2. **Prism Guild Accord (Alternate Ending)**
   - **Route:** Accumulate +2 **Prism Guild** rep through cooperative choices and resolve the dispute by granting the Guild stewardship of the tether.
   - **Outcome:** End the arc with a formal accord, granting the player a **prism shard** cache.

3. **Fail-Soft: Wind Choir Mediation without Clause**
   - **Route:** If the clause retrieval fails, the player can still convene a mediation via **Resonant** or a **favor**.
   - **Outcome:** The dispute is resolved with a provisional ruling (no rep loss), but the player misses out on a stronger reward and is sent to the next hub with a cautionary note.

## Definition of Done (Story Module)
A story module is a connected set of nodes covering a full arc (start → conflict → resolution) and at least one ending.

- [ ] Golden path playthrough finishes in ~15–30 minutes and has a clean ending.
- [ ] 2–3 alternate endings exist, including at least one fail-soft route (no hard locks).
- [ ] Every node follows world bible authoring rules (3–5 choices, tag-gated + tagless routes, vivid prose).
- [ ] Tag/trait/reputation beats are distributed across the module (at least one of each).
- [ ] Run `python tools/validate.py` and address all errors.
- [ ] Run `python tools/list_unreachable.py` to confirm no unreachable nodes remain.
- [ ] Playtest the module end-to-end and log notes in `/playtests/`.
- [ ] Localization keys exist for all new strings (titles, choice text, outcomes), and are consistent with existing localization conventions.
